"The US education system is failing." 

You'll hear plenty of claims to that effect in the media these days.  You'll see it in [newspaper headlines](http://news.yahoo.com/romney-opens-front-vs-obama-schools-failing-002320804.html), in [documentary films](http://www.waitingforsuperman.com/action/). You'll hear pundits, philanthropists, and politicians all repeat it on TV.  And according to a 2011 [Gallup poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/149093/parents-americans-positive-local-schools.aspx), most Americans agree:  less than 1% of those surveyed gave our nation's schools an "A."

Yet, many of these same people -- particularly parents with school-age children -- gave their *local* schools an "A."  In fact, this latest poll had more parents than ever before do just that -- 37%, the highest percentage since Gallup started asking Americans about the state of the school system back in 1984.  Less than 5% gave their local schools a failing grade.  Clearly there's a major gulf between our experiences with schools and our perceptions about them.   

Concerns about the state of public education in the US are hardly new.  Indeed, Gallup started polling Americans on this topic back over three decades ago, partly as a response to the publication of [*A Nation at Risk*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Nation_at_Risk) in 1983, a study commissioned by President Reagan that helped establish what's become a national narrative about a broken public school system.  

"Our once unchallenged preeminence in commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world," the report warned, due to a "rising tide of mediocrity" in our schools.  The indications of failure, according to *A Nation at Risk*:  American students' test scores in math, reading, and science are falling, while the scores from students in other countries are on the rise.  Colleges are having to offer more remedial classes.  Students who graduate from college don't score well on achievement tests.  Companies and the military are having to spend millions to retrain and remediate in basic reading, writing, and computation skills.  Add the increasing demands of computers and widespread computer illiteracy, and we simply don't have enough high-skilled workers.  

This list of problems is strikingly similar to the arguments made today about so-called failing schools.  Here are a few more recent statistics -- ones that have made headlines lately -- that echo the same risks identified in 1983:

The latest [OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) scores](http://www.oecd.org/document/61/0,3746,en_32252351_32235731_46567613_1_1_1_1,00.html), for example, ranked the US number 17 in the world in science and number 23 in reading.  The math scores of US students weren't high enough to make the Top 25. 

[SAT scores in 2011](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904491704576571060049856724.html) were down from the previous year, with the reading scores hitting the lowest level in almost 40 years.

Published in early 2011, [*Academically Adrift*](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?isbn=9780226028552) argued that some 36% of students "did not demonstrate any significant improvement in learning" over four years of college.

The [latest Census](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/education/census-finds-bachelors-degrees-at-record-level.html) found that the 30% of Americans have bachelor's degrees, the highest percentage ever.  [But outstanding student loan debt](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/business/student-loans-weighing-down-a-generation-with-heavy-debt.html?pagewanted=all) has topped $1 trillion.  The class of 2010 graduated owing about $25000 in loans.

[Each year](http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2012/2012006.pdf), approximately 1.3 million students fail to graduate from high school.  Just 75.5% of students ever will.

On one hand, all this data supports the argument that, indeed, the system is broken.  But it would also suggest that 30 years of education reform following *A Nation at Risk* -- more standardized testing, more accountability -- has changed little.  Part of that could be the institutional inertia of a system unwilling and unable to change.  Teachers unions are often blamed as standing in the way.  But these statistics often overlook the larger societal issues that schools must deal with but that they do not control:

Of those who fail to graduate high school, more than half are students of color.  The graduation rates for students of color is as much as 25% behind those of their white peers.  

Students in public schools in which more than half of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches scored, on average, [below the overall OECD and US average scores](http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2011/2011004.pdf) in reading literacy. In those schools where less than 25% of students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, students scored above average.

The [higher the family income](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/sat-scores-and-family-income/), the better a student performs on the SAT.

But almost a [quarter of children](http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/rc10_eng.pdf) in the US live in poverty.  That rate is higher than any other "advanced nation" in the world, except Romania.

So when we insist that the schools are failing -- when we point to test scores as the primary indication and the education system as the culprit -- what factors are we overlooking?  Why after 30 years of education reform -- reform that's been focused on standardized testing and "accountability" -- are we still telling the same stories about failing schools?  Is it that schools haven't changed, or is it that some of these other external issues -- income disparity, for example -- are worsening? And who benefits from maintaining a narrative that schools are failing?  Is it those who are selling a "fix"?
