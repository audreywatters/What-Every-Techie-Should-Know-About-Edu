Connectivism is a theory of pedagogy that’s focused on networks — “connections,” if you will, between nodes of information and knowledge. Connectivism draws on earlier learning theories (particularly constructionism and social learning), updated to recognize the ways in which Internet technologies have facilitated an explosion of always-changing information as well as how these technologies help facilitate a sort of networked learning.

Connectivism sees learning as about making the connections between nodes on the network. That means that learning isn’t about gaining knowledge per se, but about building the connections between knowledge sources. “In connectivism,” [writes Stephen Downes](http://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2007/02/what-connectivism-is.html), one of the theory’s originators, “there is no real concept of transferring knowledge, making knowledge, or building knowledge. Rather, the activities we undertake when we conduct practices in order to learn are more like growing or developing ourselves and our society in certain (connected) ways.”

In a networked society, these information sources can be both human and machine. The important thing is for learners to be able to *access* these nodes rather than — to use a computer analogy — *store* the information locally. Although the emphasis is on cooperation and collectivity, connectivism also recognizes that the learning process is radically personal. Indeed, one learner’s connections will never match another’s as there is no single body of knowledge to be learned.

The pedagogical methods associated with connectivism rely heavily on open, diverse and distributed resources and technologies. Downes, for example, has built a tool called [gRSShopper](http://grsshopper.downes.ca/) that combines RSS aggregation with personal Web publishing. Connectivism —  specifically the work of George Siemens and Stephen Downes — has also been associated with Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), a way of teaching in large, networked spaces that the two (and others) helped develop in 2008.
