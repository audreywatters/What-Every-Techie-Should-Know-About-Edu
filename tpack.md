(Technological) Pedagogical Content Knowledge

*How* you teach and *what* you teach are deeply intertwined, but often we treat these in isolation. We focus either on pedagogy — the “how” part — or on subject matter expertise — the “what” part. In the late 1980s, education professor [Lee Shulman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Shulman) helped bring the idea of “pedagogical content knowledge” to light, arguing that that intersection of “how” and “what” is a critical aspect of good teaching.  

Pedagogical content knowledge (or PCK) means knowing how to structure content for teaching to students and having different strategies for addressing students’ needs (both their confusions and their “a-ha” moments) as they move through the content. PCK also means being aware of common difficulties that students face when learning particular content — what’s easy and what’s challenging to learn — and how to build on students’ prior knowledge in order to move them into new content areas.

But technology is changing how we teach and how we learn — or it certainly has the potential to do so. How does adding technology to the mix change PCK? Or rather, how should it?

University of Michigan professors Punya Mishra and Matthew Koehler have expanded on Shulman’s ideas to construct the [TPACK](http://www.tpck.org/) framework — Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge. This adds a third element — the knowledge needed by a teacher for teaching with technology.  Koehler and Mishra often depict this as a [Venn Diagram](http://mkoehler.educ.msu.edu/tpack/files/2011/05/tpack.jpg) — where content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, and technological knowledge intersect.

As such, there are 7 areas in this framework:
**Technology Knowledge** (TK):  Knowing how to use a particular tool — hardware or software or even chalkboards — in the classroom
**Content Knowledge** (CK): Command of a subject
**Pedagogical Knowledge** (PK):  Understanding how learners learn, knowing different teaching and assessment methods, and having a familiarity with different theories of teaching and learning.
**Pedagogical Content Knowledge** (PCK):  Knowing how to teach a particular topic effectively
**Technological Content Knowledge** (TCK): Understanding how technologies can aid teaching and learning content
**Technological Pedagogical Knowledge** (TPK): Understanding both the strengths and the weaknesses of using technologies to teach — that is, how different technologies and different pedagogies work (or don’t)
**Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge** (TPCK): The intersection between domain expertise, pedagogy, and technology

Much like Shulman’s arguments about pedagogical content knowledge, the TPACK  framework contends that we cannot view these areas in isolation and that good teaching requires understand all three. This is particularly important to consider when thinking about people with domain expertise — say, programmers — teaching programming to novices.

But it’s important too when thinking about how all teachers should integrate technology into their own classes.  According to Koehler, “Given that educational technologies are not yet well-integrated into instruction in most K-12 classrooms; that teachers’ instructional planning tends to be activity-based and content-focused; that learning activities are conceptualized and enacted differently in different disciplines; and that effective technology integration requires interdependent content, technological, and pedagogical knowledge [we] suggest that a logical approach to helping teachers to better integrate technologies in their teaching is to directly link students’ content-related learning needs with particular content-based learning activities and related educational technologies that will best support the activities’ successful implementation.”

The TPACK framework helps us think about the ways in which technology changes teaching practices. It also underscores the fact that adding technology to the classroom isn’t simply a matter of teaching teachers how to use a tool — basic technological knowledge — but rather requires considering how teachers can use tools in the service of good pedagogy and improved learning.
