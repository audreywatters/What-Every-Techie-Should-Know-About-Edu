##History of Education Technology (and Ed-Tech Failures)##

The ed-tech website [Edudemic](http://edudemic.com/2011/04/classroom-technology/) traces the “evolution of classroom technology” from starting in 1650 with the Horn Book and to 1850 with the Ferule. It’s also posted an [infographic](http://edudemic.com/2012/04/the-history-of-learning-tools-infographic/) with the “history of learning tools” that dates back to the rod (all three of these point to the connections between technologies and discipline, but perhaps that’s another story). The Wikipedia entry for “[virtual learning environments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_virtual_learning_environments)” dates back to 1728 — “March 20, Boston Gazette contains an advertisement from Caleb Phillipps, ‘Teacher of the New Method of Short Hand,’ advising that any ‘Persons in the Country desirous to Learn this Art, may by having the several Lessons sent weekly to them, be as perfectly instructed as those that live in Boston.’” An “[online learning history](http://docs.moodle.org/23/en/Online_Learning_History)” posted on the Moodle.org website chooses a more recent starting point — 1960 — with the development of the PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations) system.

But even 1960 is still over 50 years ago. The point, evident in each of these histories: education technology is hardly new.

##Why Has Ed-Tech Failed?##

Even if we’re just counting those last 50 years or so of education computing technology, it’s hard to argue that ed-tech has radically transformed how we teach and learn. So why has ed-tech failed to do so?

The question of ed-tech failure is the subject of Stanford University professor Larry Cuban’s 2003 book [Oversold and Underused](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674011090) in which he examines the marketing promises of education technology companies and the software and hardware they sell to schools — “this will revolutionize education!” Cuban contrasts this with the realities of with how technologies are used in the classroom, as well as how they’re used at home.

Part of the problem with education technology, Cuban argues, is that teachers have had very little voice in its adoption. Because of the way in which sales of computer hardware and software have typically work — that is, procurement at the district level — the introdution of new technology tools into the classroom often comes from the top down, rather than from the bottom up. In other words, technology is introduced, but not adopted; expensive purchases for computers, interactive whiteboards, and the like frequently go unused.

When they are used, these new technologies often don’t change teaching and learning either. In the case of those interactive whiteboards, for example, many teachers simply used them as they would the chalkboards they were designed to replace.

There have been other problems with the introdution of ed-tech as well, including the lack of devices for each student (many classrooms just have one desktop computer, and while schools did build computer labs to house rows of machines, classes held there were frequently restricted to keyboarding, world processing, or testing. 

Certainly the latest explosion in mobile technologies and Internet-connected devices is changing some of this. Although schools do still struggle with things like Internet bandwidth, new technologies are increasingly finding their way into the classroom by way of teachers — and more importantly, perhaps — by way of students themselves.
