##Seymour Papert and the Legacy of Logo##

Often called the “father of educational computing,” South African-born Seymour Papert is one of the most influential educational researchers and theorists when it comes to the intersection of computing and learning. A mathematician, Papert is a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence. He helped found the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT, as well as the MIT Media Lab. Drawing on the work of Jean Piaget, Papert developed the theory of constructionism, which at risk of over-simplification, can be described as the idea of “learning by making.” 

Papert’s 1980 book [Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas](http://books.google.com/books/about/Mindstorms.html?id=HhIEAgUfGHwC) was an early argument for how the use of computers could reshape how we learn:

>”In many schools today, the phrase ‘computer-aided instruction’ means making the computer teach the child. One might say the *computer is being used to program the child*. In my vision, *the child programs the computer* and, in doing so, both acquires a sense of mastery over a piece of the most modern and powerful technology and establishes an intimate contact with some of the deepest ideas from science, from mathematics, and from the art of intellectual model building.”

And while Lego’s programmable robotics kit [Mindstorms](http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx) takes its name from that book, Papert’s role in developing educational programming tools pre-dates Mindstorms by almost four decades — back to the development in 1967 of the programming language Logo.

##Logo##

"Logo is the name for a philosophy of education and a continually evolving family of programming languages that aid in its realization,” says [MIT’s Hal Abelson](http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/logo/index.html). Indeed, the programming language created by Papert draws on, adds to, and fully supports his constructionist theories. That is, learning Logo isn’t simply about learning programming for programming sake; it’s part of a larger effort to learn through building, playing, and making things and in doing so exploring math, science, and art.

Logo is adapted from the Lisp programming language and designed to have a very low barrier to entry so that computer novices, specifically young children, can utilize it. Logo can be utilized to teach some of the basics of computer science, but it also supports more sophisticated programming projects as well.

The most popular and best known Logo environment involved the Turtle. Originally this was a robot that sat on the floor tethered to a computer and that could be directed to move around through commands it was given. Later the Turtle became an onscreen cursor as well, again so as to respond to the movement and drawing instructions given to it.  

The Turtle had three attributes: a location, a direction, and a pen (which in turn could have a color and/or a width). The Turtle moves based on the commands relative to its position.  “right 45,” for example, turns the Turtle 45 degrees to the right, then “forward 5” moves the Turtle forward from that new direction. The Turtle can repeat a command — “repeat 4 [forward 50 right 90]” — and also be taught new words:

>to square
repeat 4 [forward 50 right 90]
end

The visual nature of the Turtle movement and drawing gives students immediate feedback on their programming, helping them debug their work.

##Logo’s Legacy##

In addition to the Lego Mindstorm kit, there are other educational programming tools that draw on Papert’s work and take a constructionist approach to learning. These include [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu), developed at MIT Media Lab under one of Papert’s former students Mitchel Resnick; [Smalltalk](http://www.smalltalk.org/main/), created at XEROX Park by Alan Kay and others; and Etoys, also created by Kay.

(Papert’s influence can also be seen in the [One Laptop Per Child](http://laptop.org) initiative, whose “Children’s Machines” were initially designed not simply to put low-cost computing devices into children’s hands but to make these computers open source and tinkerable.)
